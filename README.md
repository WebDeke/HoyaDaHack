##### Intended for judges, however the viewing public is welcome to take a look.

Hey! We wanted to make this guide in order to help provide you information about our repository as there are a lot of things on there, both current and old.

#### To view current implementations, view the following files

##### Frontend

- Live demo [here.](https://findyouracademicweaponwith.tech) (if that doesn't work, try [this.](https://webdeke-hoyadahack-new-app-oxxkyj.streamlit.app/))
- Code for this demonstration is `new-app.py` on our Github repository [here.](https://github.com/WebDeke/HoyaDaHack).

##### Algorithm

- Live demo [here.](https://replit.com/@WebDeke1/Commilito-Demo)
- Code for this demonstration is `new-algo.py` on our Github repository [here.](https://github.com/WebDeke/HoyaDaHack).

##### Database Schema

- Code for this demonstration is
- Integration was attempted in `db.py` in our repository.

#### Some past implementations

##### Frontend

`work_in_progress.py` and `new-test.py` were attempts to integrate everything with a Google Sheets DB and rudimentary versions of our final frontend, respectively.

##### Backend

The `backend` folder along with `db.py` in our repository are our current attempts at integration and creating a backend.
The `algo.py` in our repository are our previous attempts at an algo for demonstration purposes.

#### Miscellaneous

The `other-idea` folder has some previous attempts at integrations and the file name is a relic of a time when we had another idea brewing but believed in this one a bit more.
